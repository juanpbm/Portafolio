# **Motion Detection using 1-D Temporal Derivatives**

## Abstract 

In this project, we used temporal derivatives to highlight moving objects in a sequence of images. 
We varied the inputs by first blurring the set of images by applying either box or gaussian filters.
We also used different derivative filters: a standard 0.5[-1 0 1] Sobel operator and 1-D derivative of a gaussian filter with various values of standard deviation.
We compared the results of using various blurring filters, derivative filters, and threshold values.
