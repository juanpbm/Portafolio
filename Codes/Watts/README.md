This program was made in Dev C++ and I did it alone.

The main purpose of this program was to learn how to use a 2D array and find some data according to the user input and give a final .txt 
file with the information required. The file power.txt contains data of the power consumed by a certain device throughout the day for 10
weeks (every row of the array is the data of a week) which the program will import the data from. The user can select to get the average
of a single week, a range of weeks or the average or the average of every week. Also, the program will find the minimum value of the power of the 10 weeks and tell the user which
day and which week that power was consumed by the device.
