This program was made in Dev C++ and I did it alone.

The main purpose of this program was to learn how to use a 2D array and find some data according to the user input and give a final .txt 
file with the information required. The file power.txt contains data of the power consumed by a certain device throughout the day over a span of 10 weeks. Every row of data in the array represents a week, and the program imports this data from the power.txt file. The user can select the average of a single week, a range of weeks or the sum of the weeks. Additionally, the program will find the minimum value of the power consumption over the duration of the 10 weeks and inform the user of the day and week that the device used that amount of power.
