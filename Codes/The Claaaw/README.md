# The Claaaw

This project was made in Arduino programing language. This project was made in a group of 5 people and I was the leader of the coding. 

These 2 programs were made to control a robot called The Claaaw using Arduino UNO.

## Control
The Control program controlled the basic functions of a vehicle. DC motors,
IR sensor, temperature sensor, and motion sensor.

All the functions were controlled by a regular TV remote control and an IR sensor. The main functions to be controlled were go forward, go backward
turn left, turn right and stop. The temperature sensor and the motion sensor were used to keep the robot safe so it wouldn't crash or approach a 
zone or object that had a temperature too high or too low. 

## Arm
The arm program controlled the robotic arm. It was controlled by the same TV remote control and IR sensor. This time 4 servo motors were controlled,
360 rotation motion, first up and down, second up and down and open and close the claw. and again the safety part of the code using a temperature 
sensor and motion sensor was implemented.
