# The Claaaw

This project was programmed using Arduino. This coding was made by me as contribution to a wider group project that including design assembly and presentation of a robot. 

These 2 programs were made to control a robot called The Claaaw using Arduino UNO.

## Control
The Control program controlled the basic functions of the vehicle: the DC motors, IR sensor, temperature sensor, and motion sensor. All the functions were controlled by a standard  TV remote control and an IR sensor. The main functions to be controlled were go forward, go backward turn left, turn right and stop. The temperature sensor and the motion sensor were used to keep the robot safe so it wouldn't crash or approach a zone or object that had a temperature too high or too low. 

## Arm
The arm program controlled the robotic arm. It was controlled by the same TV remote control and IR sensor. This time, however, 4 servo motors were controlled which enabled 180 degree rotation, vertical motion for both the arm and the claw, and the successful opening and closing of the robot's claw to retrieve objects. Similar to the code in Control, the same safety precautions were included for temperature 
and motion.
