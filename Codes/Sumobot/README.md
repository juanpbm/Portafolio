# Sumobot code 

This code was made in Arduino. I worked in a group of 4 and I was the leader of the code. 

This code was made to control a small robot using Arduino UNO with the main purpose of simulating a sumo fight. There was a white ring in a black mat, 2 robots would be placed in the middle of the ring and the first robot to get out (either if it was pushed out or simply drove away) of the ring would lose. The robot had 2 color sensors (only white and black) on the side and one distance sensor in the front. The code is a strategy to push the other robot away and prevent driving out of the ring. First, the front sensor will see if there is something in front if there is something (the other robot) in less than 6 inches it will go forward until the other robot it's out or it gets away. If there is nothing in front it will start turning around until it finds something. Also, if when it is turning or going straight, and the color sensors senses the ring (white) it will go backward and move the opposite direction of the sensor that sensed the ring (if the left sensor sensed the ring it'll go right and vice-versa) and if both sens it at the same time it'll go backward and turn left. The competition consisted of two rounds in which we got the second place in both of them.
