# **EECE2560 Fundamentals Engineering of Algorithms**

## Juan Pablo Bernal & Augusto Rivas 

### Class Description: 
Covers the design and implementation of algorithms to solve engineering problems using a high-level programming language. Reviews elementary data structures, such as arrays, stacks, queues, and lists, and introduces more advanced structures, such as trees and graphs and the use of recursion. Covers both the algorithms to manipulate these data structures as well as their use in problem solving. Introduces algorithm complexity analysis and its application to developing efficient algorithms. Emphasizes the importance of software engineering principles.

### Projects:
Each project is divided into 2 parts, a and b. Both parts tackle the same problem where part a is the first approach and part b is the final solution. The name Berriv that is in every file, is a code name to identify our team.
