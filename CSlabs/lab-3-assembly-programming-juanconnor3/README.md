## Getting the Lab

1. First open a terminal and ssh into the Khoury servers ``` ssh khoury_user_name_here@login.khoury.neu.edu ```
2. Navigate to your class directory (use the `cd` command to change directory, `ls` to see files, and `pwd` to see your path)
3. When you are within your directory, do a ```git clone <repository name>```. This will clone the repository on to khoury servers and you are ready to work on your lab.

For some reason, you are unable to login to the khoury servers, you can use the ```git clone``` command locally on your machine and start working. You can later push the changes and do simply follow the ```git clone``` command within khoury servers once you get a chance to login. Master the git workflow.
